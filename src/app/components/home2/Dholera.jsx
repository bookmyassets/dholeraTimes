              Dholera Smart City is India’s first planned smart city, being
              developed under the prestigious Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor
              (DMIC). Spread across 922.5 sq. km, Dholera SIR is planned as a
              world-class industrial and manufacturing hub with modern
              infrastructure, smart utilities, sustainable energy solutions, and
              seamless global connectivity.
              <br />
              Strategically located just 109 km from Ahmedabad, the city is well
              connected through the Ahmedabad–Dholera Expressway and the
              upcoming Dholera International Airport, which is set to be one of
              India’s largest airports. Backed by major investments such as Tata
              Semiconductor Plant (₹91,000 CR), ReNew Power Project (₹1,200 CR),
              and one of the world’s largest solar power parks, Dholera Smart
              City is rapidly emerging as a next-generation economic and
              industrial powerhouse of India.
