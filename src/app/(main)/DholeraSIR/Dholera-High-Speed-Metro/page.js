                  The central government has approved a High Speed Metro And
                  Rail project which will run through
                  Ahmedabad-Dholera-Gandhinagar. The project will unfold in two
                  phases with phase 1 connecting Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar while
                  phase 2 will link Gandhinagar to Dholera Smart city via GIFT
                  city.

                  The National Highways Authority Of India (NHAI) has designated
                  a 120-metre-wide strip extending from Dholera SIR to Ahmedabad
                  as a part of this project. Three-fourths of this strip would
                  be used for a six-lane highway and one-fourth for a metro
                  link, both running parallel. The planned Mass Rapid Transit
                  System (MRTS), or monorail, will connect Ahmedabad to the
                  Dholera Special Investment Region, spanning 100 kilometres
                  with 70 stations along the routes.

                  Dholeraâ€™s metro project is designed to accommodate 80,000
                  passengers per hour and 1.7 million commuters by 2031.
