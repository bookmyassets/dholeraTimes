                Dholera SIR is quite strategically located. With world-class
                infrastructure and seamless multimodal connectivity, it is
                setting the stage for a world-class change. The Dholera SIR
                project has proximity to mega cities like Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar,
                Vadodara, and Gujarat International Finance TechCity (GIFT).

                Considered an investment paradise by many realtors today, the
                Dholera SIR project is expected to yield 15-20% returns
                annually. This high ROI is driven by its government-backed
                development, rapid infrastructure growth, and emerging
                semiconductor industry.

                Intracity connectivity is ensured with blacktop roads, metros,
                and smart buses. For intercity, interstate, and international
                connectivity, Dholera SIR has easy access through road, rail,
                air, and sea. The six-lane Central Spine Expressway connects
                Dholera to Ahmedabad. The Gulf of Khambhat sea ports open
                Dholera SIRâ€™s avenues to the entire world - both freight and
                passengers. Public investment is driving core infrastructure
                development, making Dholera a critical hub in the DMIC.
